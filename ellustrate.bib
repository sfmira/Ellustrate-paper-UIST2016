They feel like stickers but behave like electronic units and can be stuck to any conductive connector, such as copper foil tape, conductive ink or conductive thread, to make circuits. The toolkit includes, LEDs, sensors, pre-programmed function generators and a programmable microcontroller. Along with the circuit stickers, we have also created a suite of educational support resources such as the Circuit Sticker Sketchbook, which contains lessons and activities for crafting circuits onto templates inside the book.

	abstract = {An increasing number of consumer products include user interfaces that rely on touch input. While digital fabrication techniques such as 3D printing make it easier to prototype the shape of custom devices, adding interactivity to such prototypes remains a challenge for many designers. We introduce Midas, a software and hardware toolkit to support the design, fabrication, and programming of flexible capacitive touch sensors for interactive objects. With Midas, designers first define the desired shape, layout, and type of touch sensitive areas, as well as routing obstacles, in a sensor editor. From this high-level specification, Midas automatically generates layout files with appropriate sensor pads and routed connections. These files are then used to fabricate sensors using digital fabrication processes, e.g., vinyl cutters and conductive ink printers. Using step-by-step assembly instructions generated by Midas, designers connect these sensors to the Midas microcontroller, which detects touch events. Once the prototype is assembled, designers can define interactivity for their sensors: Midas supports both record-and-replay actions for controlling existing local applications and WebSocket-based event output for controlling novel or remote applications. In a first-use study with three participants, users successfully prototyped media players. We also demonstrate how Midas can be used to create a number of touch-sensitive interfaces.},

This paper presents d.tools, a toolkit that embodies an iterative-design-centered approach to prototyping information appliances. This work offers contributions in three areas. First, d.tools introduces a statechart-based visual design tool that provides a low threshold for early-stage prototyping, extensible through code for higher-fidelity prototypes. Second, our research introduces three important types of hardware extensibility - at the hardware-to-PC interface, the intra-hardware communication level, and the circuit level. Third, d.tools integrates design, test, and analysis of information appliances. We have evaluated d.tools through three studies: a laboratory study with thirteen participants; rebuilding prototypes of existing and emerging devices; and by observing seven student teams who built prototypes with d.tools.},

However, the standard mediums for circuit design and construction remain the breadboard, protoboard, and printed circuit board (PCB). As an alternative, we introduce a method in which circuits are hand-made on ordinary paper substrates, connected with conductive foil tape and off-the-shelf circuit components with the aim of supporting the durability, scalability, and accessibility needs of novice and expert circuit builders alike. We also used electrified notebooks to investigate how the circuit design and build process would be affected by the constraints and affordances of the bound book. Our ideas and techniques were evaluated through a series of workshops, through which we found our methods supported a wide variety of approaches and results - both technical and expressive - to electronics design and construction.},

Modkit tools work with the Arduino platform's library of code (such as C/C++) to enable users to participate in a community rich with project ideas and sample files. Modkit supports multiple representations of code - graphical command blocks can become editable text-based code to offer additional avenues for learning and sharing. The Studio welcomes members of the research, industrial, academic, maker, and I-just-want-to-have fun communities of all experience levels to participate. Participants will have opportunities to use Modkit in personally-meaningful ways. Participants who wish to extend Modkit tools with new functionality will have opportunities to do so. The organizers will conclude the Studio with a discussion around activities, example projects, and approaches to adapting the toolkit to different settings. Participants will contribute to brainstorming about potential uses, future directions, and collaborations.},

Despite the prevalence of software tools, most designers begin their work with physical sketches. Modern computational tools largely treat design as a linear process beginning with a specific problem and ending with a specific solution. Sketch-based design tools offer another approach that may fit design practice better. This review surveys literature related to such tools. First, we describe the practical basis of sketching — why people sketch, what significance it has in design and problem solving, and the cognitive activities it supports. Second, we survey computational support for sketching, including methods for performing sketch recognition and managing ambiguity, techniques for modeling recognizable elements, and human–computer interaction techniques for working with sketches. Last, we propose challenges and opportunities for future advances in this field.},

	abstract = {We introduce Plushie, an interactive system that allows nonprofessional users to design their own original plush toys. To design a plush toy, one needs to construct an appropriate two-dimensional (2D) pattern. However, it is difficult for nonprofessional users to appropriately design a 2D pattern. Some recent systems automatically generate a 2D pattern for a given three-dimensional (3D) model, but constructing a 3D model is itself a challenge. Furthermore, an arbitrary 3D model cannot necessarily be realized as a real plush toy, and the final sewn result can be very different from the original 3D model. We avoid this mismatch by constructing appropriate 2D patterns and applying simple physical simulation to it on the fly during 3D modeling. In this way, the model on the screen is always a good approximation of the final sewn result, which makes the design process much more efficient. We use a sketching interface for 3D modeling and also provide various editing operations tailored for plush-toy design. Internally, the system constructs a 2D cloth pattern in such a way that the simulation result matches the user's input stroke. We successfully demonstrated that nonprofessional users could design plush toys or balloon easily using Plushie.},

We argue that FiMs are design materials, fostering modeling of real-world structures, while MiMs foster modeling of more abstract structures. We show that our classification extends to computationally enhanced versions of manipulatives.We present Digital MiMs - computationally enhanced building blocks. We describe two prototypical members of the Digital MiMs class: FlowBlocks and SystemBlocks, physical, modular interactive systems that serve as general-purpose modeling and simulation tools for dynamic behavior. We present findings from qualitative studies, and conclude that digital MiMs are accessible to young children, engaging, and encourage learning of abstract structures of dynamic behavior through an iterative process of hands-on modeling, simulating, and analogizing.},

By digitally exploring various means of connecting components, users can experientially learn how to build a functioning circuit and then transition directly to building it physically.

	abstract = {We present PortraitSketch, an interactive drawing system that helps novices create pleasing, recognizable face sketches without requiring prior artistic training. As the user traces over a source portrait photograph, PortraitSketch automatically adjusts the geometry and stroke parameters (thickness, opacity, etc.) to improve the aesthetic quality of the sketch. We present algorithms for adjusting both outlines and shading strokes based on important features of the underlying source image. In contrast to automatic stylization systems, PortraitSketch is designed to encourage a sense of ownership and accomplishment in the user. To this end, all adjustments are performed in real-time, and the user ends up directly drawing all strokes on the canvas. The findings from our user study suggest that users prefer drawing with some automatic assistance, thereby producing better drawings, and that assistance does not decrease the perceived level of involvement in the creative process.},

The process of creating paper circuit prototypes with little or no specialist equipment will be explored, along with an investigation into printed patterns and grounding options for creating touch and proximity sensors with conductive paint. The methods and techniques this pictorial explores are approached from a craft viewpoint as opposed to the possibly more expected engineering approach.},

	abstract = {We propose a method that allows an unskilled user to create an accurate physical replica of a digital 3D model. We use a projector/camera pair to scan a work in progress, and project multiple forms of guidance onto the object itself that indicate which areas need more material, which need less, and where any ridges, valleys or depth discontinuities are. The user adjusts the model using the guidance and iterates, making the shape of the physical object approach that of the target 3D model over time. We show how this approach can be used to create a duplicate of an existing object, by scanning the object and using that scan as the target shape. The user is free to make the reproduction at a different scale and out of different materials: we turn a toy car into cake. We extend the technique to support replicating a sequence of models to create stop-motion video. We demonstrate an end-to-end system in which real-world performance capture data is retargeted to claymation. Our approach allows users to easily and accurately create complex shapes, and naturally supports a large range of materials and model sizes.},
